Overview of the Project:

Project: Monitor temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor with Arduino. This project introduces the concept of environmental sensing and data reading from sensors.


 Objective:

Design and implement a system to monitor temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor connected to an Arduino board.
 Key Activities:

- Interface a DHT sensor with Arduino to measure temperature and humidity.
- Write Arduino code to read sensor data.
- Display temperature and humidity values on the Serial Monitor.
- Use sensor libraries for data acquisition and processing.
- Upload and run the code on the Arduino board.

 Technologies Used:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- DHT11/DHT22 sensor (temperature and humidity)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- DHT sensor library

 Key Insights:

- Understanding how to interface sensors with the Arduino.
- Reading data from the DHT sensor using sensor libraries.
- Working with temperature and humidity data.
- Familiarity with data acquisition and processing in Arduino.
- Use of the Serial Monitor to visualize sensor output.
